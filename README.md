# React Native: 'undefined is not an object' error - Component Usage Before Definition

This repository demonstrates an uncommon 'undefined is not an object' error in React Native that occurs when a component is used before it has been fully defined.  The error arises from asynchronous loading or incorrect import order.  The solution involves restructuring the component hierarchy and/or utilizing techniques like conditional rendering or promises to handle asynchronous loading gracefully.

## Problem

The `Bug.js` file contains a flawed React Native component that attempts to use another component before it has completed its definition or loading. This leads to the error:  'undefined is not an object (evaluating 'ComponentB.name').'

## Solution

The `BugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The key is either ensuring ComponentB is fully loaded before rendering in ComponentA, using techniques like conditional rendering based on loading status, or refactoring to remove direct dependency.
